# Portfolio Website
- Completely modular full-stack portfolio using MERN
- As the admin of the website, I can sign-in and edit anything and everything
- No longer need to touch the source code and can entirely interact with the UI
- Netlify and Heroku used for the frontend and backend respectively

## Technologies Used
- ReactJS, MongoDB, NodeJS, Express
- React bootstrap, emailjs, react router, axios, cors, mongoose

## Future Changes
- Improve aesthetics
- Add drag and drop to the projects page for easy reordering

## Completed Changes
- Improve responsiveness on mobile (used media queries and react-responsive)
- Refactor context variables (projects and home content dont need to be in context) *Switched to single-page design*

- I normally let the website explain itself but because the user can't see most of the features I implemented, a demo is needed
